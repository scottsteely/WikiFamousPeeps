Wiki Famous People -*- mode: org -*-

* Wikipedia /Semi/ famous person downloader

** The Python Script:

*** Wikidata
 Get a set of random people from *Wikidata* that meet the following criteria:
        1. Born on the year provided by rand()
        2. Has a pic on file
        3. Is not a sports figure
        4. The associated wiki article has a minimum of 20 inbound inter-wiki site links

*** Wikipedia
 After getting the list from *Wikidata* it will then use the *Wikipedia* API to get the text version of the article. For the blurb only the first 2 sentences are retained. Dump this into a txt file with the corresponding name.

 After that, it will request a specific size image from Wikipedia so that we don't get huge pictures and we have a set column with for later.

 Using Image Magick, convert the pictures in SIXEL format for the terminal.

        - Image Magick :: because I might want to add a border or post processing later

** The Bash Script:
*YOU NEED A TERMINAL THAT CAN DISPLAY SIXEL IMAGES*

 1. Looks in ./wiki_pis for SIXEL
 2. Pick one from random
 3. CAT the corresponding txt file with TPUT
 4. CAT the SIXEL

** WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS???

 The idea for this Frankenstein python script came from the fact that I wanted something like neofetch for interesting Wikipedia people. That way when ever I open my terminal I have a new interesting person to learn about.

** TODO:
1. Check if ./wiki_pics is there
2. Comment so stuff
3. Format the blur better
4. Add link to the blurb
5. Make it fancier with imagemagick

* Here it is in action!
